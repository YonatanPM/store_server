This project is my first server built using node js

It simulates store server using the express framework and MongoDB database.
The data passed from the UI is processed and stored by the mongoose library aided by Joi for validation.
jwt library supplies the app authentication and authorization services  
using express routers enabled the server endpoints to be separated by functionality
most of the server endpoints will apply to requests without URL path intensely since at the time no UI application was available.

Rest client HTTP requests are available in the project respiratory for server testing
